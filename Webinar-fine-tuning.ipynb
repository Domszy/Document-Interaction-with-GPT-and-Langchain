To do so, we will replicate some steps: \n    - **STEP 1**: Having our concrete objective clear\n    - **STEP 2**: Choose a pre-trained model and a dataset\n    - **STEP 3**: Load the data to use\n    - **STEP 4**: Tokenizer\n    - **STEP 5**: Initialize our base model\n    - **STEP 6**: Evaluate method\n    - **STEP 7**: Fine-tune using the Trainer Method\n\n\n**Requirements**\n\nFor this tutorial, the following libraries are needed: \n- Throughout the whole tutorial, we will be using the `transformers` library. \n- For the fine-tuning either `pytorch` or `tensorflow` are required. (This Notebook will be implemented with `pytorch`)\n- To push the fine-tuned model to HuggingFace, the `HuggingFace_hub`library is required.
